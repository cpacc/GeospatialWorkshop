# Workshop in Geospatial Analysis

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This two-day workshop focuses on building skill in geospatial analysis through a combination of lectures, exercises and hands-on work.  The aim is to learn basic theory and methods underlying spatial mapping and analysis.  We will use the R programming language throughout to illustrate concepts and methods.

We cover selected topics in geospatial analysis in a largely applied (non-theoretical) context, including

* key concepts in geospatial analysis
* characteristics of geospatial data
* methods for mapping and descriptive analysis

Detailed lecture material is found in the *slides* folder.  Hands-on examples and activities using pre-written R code are available in the *R* folder for practical skill development.  Additional useful sources of information, as well as tutorials on working in R, can be found in the *resources* folder.

Some basic familiarity with data manipulation in R is a helpful pre-requisite.  Having experience using *tidyverse* packages is an asset.
